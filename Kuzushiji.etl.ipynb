The nature of this task highly depends on the type of data source. Whether it is relational or unstructured, enterprise data or internet data, persistent data or streaming data. This heavily influences the choice of architecture. Therefore, you must document your choice and thinking process in the Architectural Decision Document (ADD).\n\nThis task involves \u2013 as the name implies \u2013 accessing the data source, transforming it in a way it can be easily worked with and finally make it available to downstream analytics processes \u2013 either real-time streaming or batch ones.\n\nIn case of operational relational data, de-normalization usually needs to take place, for unstructured data, some feature extraction might already be appropriate and for real-time data, windows are usually created.\n\nPlease create an ETL process, document it and save this deliverable according to the naming convention of the process model."
