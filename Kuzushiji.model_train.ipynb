In the most simple case Model Definition and Model Training is just a couple of LOCs (lines of code) away. In the case of Watson Machine Learning or Apache Spark models might need to get serialized and transferred to another technology / framework.\n\nPlease specify and justify the technologies used for model definition and training in the ADD. \n\nOnce you think you have achieved a descent model performance save the notebook according to the process model\u2019s naming convention and proceed to the model evaluation task."
