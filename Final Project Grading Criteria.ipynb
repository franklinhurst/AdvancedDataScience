For each item you find coverage in the video please assign one point.\n\n- Use Case\n- Data Set\n- Data Quality Assessment\n- Data Exploration (e.g. correlation between columns)\n- Data Visualization (e.g. value distribution of columns)\n- At least one Feature Engineering (e.g. imputing missing values) applied\n- Selection and justification of Model Performance Indicator (e.g. F1 score)\n- At least one traditional Machine Learning Algorithm and one DeepLearning Algorithm applied and demonstrated\n- Model performance between different feature engineerings  and models compared and documented\n\nPlease assign one point for each item below which is properly covered in the ADD\n\n- Why have I chosen a specific method for data quality assessment?\n- Why have I chosen a specific method for feature engineering?\n- Why have I chosen a specific algorithm?\n- Why have I chosen a specific framework?\n- Why have I chosen a specific model performance indicator?\n\nPlease provide a list of IBM Watson Studio Notebook permalinks GIST to your notebooks you consider as your data product\n\nLearn how to share a GIST of your notebooks\n\nhttps://github.com/IBM/coursera/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-share-a-gist-of-my-notebook\n\n\nPlease review the notebooks and assign points according to how many of the following items are properly covered\n\n- The notebooks are clearly structured and documented\n- The notebooks contain visualizations in the data quality assessment steps\n- The notebooks reveal the overall data processing steps ETL->Feature Engineering->Model Training/Evaluation/Selection->Final Result\n- The notebooks contain visualizations in the model performance assessment steps\n- The notebooks show the answers to the questions defined in the Usecase"
