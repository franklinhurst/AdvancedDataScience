The key to everything is that the business insights that result from the model are made available to stakeholders. This can happen in various ways. At the simplest level a PDF report is generated (e.g. using a jupyter notebook in Watson Studio) and handed over to business stakeholders. Alternatively, the model is encapsulated behind a REST API and made either available to be consumed by a data product or sold internally or externally as a API (e.g. by using IBM Watson Machine Learning or Fabric for DeepLearning). \n\nDepending on your use case, please choose and implement an appropriate model deployment option and justify your decisions in the ADD."
