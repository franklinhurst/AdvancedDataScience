In two dimensions it is easy to see, also can be \n# seen in 3 dimensions\n# However, we need some kind of algoritm to detect and understand \n# clusters in higher dimensions than three.  The algorithms will of\n# course work on data in two and three dimensions.\n\n# Points not within the boundaries of any cluster can be seen as outliers, once\n# we have established what constitutes a boundary of a cluster.\n\n# Instead of establishing a boundary for each cluster, we can try to draw a \n# line (in two dimensions) between the clusters.  This would be a plane in \n# three dimensions and a hyperplane in more than 3 dimensions\n\n# We can generate a 3d scatter plot with random data.  We can still see clusters\n# if they exist in 3 dimensional vector space.  If we establish boundaries of the clusters\n# in 3d space, there boundaries will be spheres.  If instead we want to separate the clusters\n# then we would use a 3d plane.  \n\n# if dimensions exist in the data greater than 3, we have several options:\n\n#  We can try to color code the data in 3d to denote what is happening in the higher dimentions,\n#  or we can use different shapes to represent the 4th and higher dimensions visually.\n#  This only works with low cardinality above 3d.  \n#  Another option is that we can remove certain dimensions from a higher dimension dataset\n#  and then plot only the most \"interesting\" dimensions in 3d or 2d.  In selecting the \n#  most \"interesting\" dimensions, we would use a correlation matrix to see which dimensions in\n#  the data have the greatest correlations with each other.  If two features have a very high\n#  correlation, then removing one of those features will not remove a large amount of most intersting\n#  relationship between the features in the data.  If one feature is highly correlated with another\n#  it is less interesting because they are both represented, mostly, but one or the other of those\n#  two highly correlated features.\n\n#  For example, suppose our dataset was composed of features related to homes on the market, and \n#  our features were things like number of bedrooms, number of bath rooms, square footage, year built,\n#  last sale price, appraisal value, sale price for sale before last sale price, yard square footage, \n#  garage square footage, etc.  Suppose we wanted to reduce the dimensionality of the data.  We might\n#  look at a correlation matrix between all these features in our data set and we might determine that\n#  there is a very high correlation betrween the last sale price and the sale price in the sale before\n#  the last sale.  Therefore we might decide to just drop the latter feature to lower the dimensionality\n#  our data, since if we have the last sale price, the sale price before last doesn't really give us\n#  all that much more information about the house.\n\n#  Another approach is to create multiple plots with different subsets of features (dimensions)\n\n#  Yet another approach is to use a mathematical method for dimensionality reduction.\n\n#  If we do not want to reduce dimensions, we can still use clustering and classifiation algorithms in \n#  higher dimensional space to determine cluster groupings and determine cluster centers.\n"
